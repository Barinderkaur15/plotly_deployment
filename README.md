# # Belly Button Biodiversity Dashborad 
### Purpose : 
In this project, we are creating a dashborad. The goal here is to create a dynamic dashborad where user can select top ten bacterial species samples from a drop down menu which is cretaed using Javascrip and deployed with help of HTML 

### Scripting Languages and Tools :

**1.** : **JavaScript** : JS , is a high-level ,Just in time compiled, object-oriented programming language . JS is used for  creating and styling various webpages with HTML .<BR>
 **->** For this project we have used  JS library like D3, D3.js helps in dynamically manipulating the data for the websites and its emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. <BR>
  
**2.**: **HTML** : HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. We have created the final website using HTML and CSS .

**3.** : **Jason** : Data is stored in Jason file Format.A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format. It is primarily used for transmitting data between a web application and a server.  <BR>

**4.** : **VS Code** : As the text Editor <br>

**5. ** : **GitHub Pages** : Is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. 

### Process: ### 

The  bacterial samples are filtered and sliced using otu_ids and Otu_labes to retieve top 10 samples from the research data. 
For doing so D3.Jason is used to dynamically fetch the data from the source file. <BR>

Jave script functional programming and aroow functions are used to manipulate the data . 

Using Plotly Graphing Library  the final output is visually represented in the form of graphs , bubble chart and gauge method .<BR>
  
The project is deployed on Github Pages . 


**Final output : **
